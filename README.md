# Dem dotfiles tho

This is what I have installed on all my machines. Please steal from it freely. I particularly recommend looking through the aliases file and any language-specific files relevant to your work.

```
git clone git://github.com/JackDanger/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd !$
rake install # safely makes symlinks, overwrites nothing
```
