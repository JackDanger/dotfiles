# Vim Syntax File for SCSS (Sassy CSS)

## Installation

I recommend to use a plugin manager like [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) for the installation.

### Vundle

Open your `~/.vimrc` file and add the following line:

```
Bundle 'cakebaker/scss-syntax.vim'
```

Afterwards, run `:BundleInstall` in Vim.

### Manual

* [Download](https://github.com/cakebaker/scss-syntax.vim/archive/master.zip) the files
* Copy the content of the folders to the respective folders in `~/.vim/`
