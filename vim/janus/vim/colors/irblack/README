This is the original IR_Black color scheme for Vim that I created long ago. It's been in my dotfiles repo, but it should really be in its own repo.

For more info, see: http://blog.toddwerth.com/entries/8

I've also included my IR_Dark and IR_Blue. I use all 3 depending on the situation.

I also made an IR_Black for OSX Terminal here: http://blog.toddwerth.com/entries/6
and one for Textmate here (wow, in 2007, crazy): http://blog.toddwerth.com/entries/2

There are many other ports of IR_Black for everything from XCode to Java IDEs etc. Google has tons of them.

Happy coding.
