INTRO                                                      *vroom-introduction*

Vroom is a plugin for running your Ruby tests, specs, and features. It allows
you to speed up your development since you don't have to jump around to
different windows or tabs.

If you're hacking away on your awesome Ruby app, and you open your spec, you
can easily run the whole file by hitting <Leader>r, or nearest test with
<Leader>R. This is then remembered, so if you switch back to your code, you
can then hit <Leader>r again and that last test will be run.

===============================================================================
INTERFACE                                                     *vroom-interface*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS                                                       *vroom-commands*

:VroomRunTestFile                                            *VroomRunTestFile*
                        Runs the current file if it is a test. Otherwise, run
                        the last test file that was run.

:VroomRunNearestTest                                      *VroomRunNearestTest*
                        Runs the nearest test in the current file if it's a
                        test. Otherwise, runs the last test that was run.

                        NOTICE:
                        Both of these commands can take pass a dictionary of
                        arguments to this function.  The two recognized keys
                        are 'runner' and 'options'.  Use 'runner' to specify the
                        full command for an alternate runner.  Use 'options' for
                        any command line switches you want to add.
                        Examples:
                        :call vroom#RunTestFile({'runner':'spin serve'})
                        " calls `spin serve file-to-be-tested`
                        :call vroom#RunTestFile({'options':'--drb'}) "
                        " if called with rspec, calls
                        " `bundle exec rspec --drb file-to-be-tested`
                        " (for if you are using Spork)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS                                               *vroom-key-mappings*

By default vroom maps <Leader>r to |VroomRunTestFile| and <Leader>R to
|VroomRunNearestTest|. This can be turned off by simply putting `let
g:vroom_map_keys = 0` in your vimrc.

===============================================================================

                        Default: 0 (write the current file)

g:vroom_cucumber_path                                     *vroom_cucumber_path*
                        If set, the path for the executable
                        used for *.feature files.
                        Default: './script/cucumber '

g:vroom_detect_spec_helper                           *vroom_detect_spec_helper*
                        Only run `bundle exec` if first line of the spec file
                        requires 'spec_helper'
                        Default: 0

g:vroom_use_vimux                                             *vroom_use_vimux*
                        Run tests using the vimux plugin

g:vroom_use_spring                                           *vroom_use_spring*
                        This lets you specify to use spring.
                        Default: 0

                        When appropriate (see |vroom_detect_spec_helper|) use
                        `bundle exec` before test runner command.  If set to
                        0, `bundle exec` is never used.
                        Default: 1

g:vroom_use_binstubs                                       *vroom_use_binstubs*
                        If set to 1, lets Vroom know you are using binstubs.
                        This means (a) the call to your test runner will be
                        prefixed with your binstubs directory (see
                        |vroom_binstubs_path|), and (b) `bundle exec` will
                        never be called (see |vroom_use_bundle_exec|).
                        Default: 0

g:vroom_binstubs_path                                     *vroom_binstubs_path*
                        If using binstubs, the directory where your binstubs
                        are installed.  The forward slash gets added
                        automatically and should not be included.
                        Default: './bin'

g:vroom_spec_command                                       *vroom_spec_command*
                        This lets you specify the command that runs your
                        specs, e.g. for rspec 1.x, you can use 'spec '.
                        Default: 'rspec '

g:vroom_test_unit_command                             *vroom_test_unit_command*
                        This lets you specify the command that runs your
                        tests, e.g. you can use 'm ' or 'testrbl '.
                        Default: 'ruby -Itest '

g:vroom_rspec_version                                     *vroom_rspec_version*
                        This lets you specify the rspec version. It's used
                        to choose rspec version-specific command line args
                        (e.g. color). Use "1.x" or "2.x".
                        Default: '2.x'

g:vroom_use_zeus                                      *vroom_use_zeus*
                        This lets you specify to use zeus instead of bundler,
                        if zeus is not running, it will fallback to using
                        bundler.
                        Default: 1
